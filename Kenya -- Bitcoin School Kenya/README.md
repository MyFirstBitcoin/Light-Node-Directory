## 📖 About Us

Bitcoin School Kenya: Simplifying The Complexities Of Bitcoin Making It Understandable To Everyone

Launched on February 10, 2024, Bitcoin School Kenya emerged with a bold missionto simplify Bitcoin for all Kenyans, regardless of age, language, or technical background. Bitcoin School Kenya fills a critical gap by prioritizing local language accessibility and cultural inclusivity.

Why We’re Different
Language First, Technology Second

Bitcoin School Kenya goes further by integrating 42 Kenyan languages, including Sheng (urban youth slang), Kikuyu, and other vernaculars. This ensures even non-English speakers in rural and urban areas can grasp Bitcoin’s fundamentals.

For example, lessons are tailored using relatable analogies rooted in local traditions, such as comparing Bitcoin’s scarcity to communal resource management practices.

Age-Inclusive Learning

Bitcoin School Kenya targets all age groups. Grandparents learn alongside teenagers, enhancing intergenerational financial literacy.

Tools for Practical Adoption

Students gain hands-on experience with Bitcoin wallets, Lightning Network apps, and tools for everyday use mirroring initiatives like Bitcoin Ekasi in South Africa and Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador

Vision: 
Bitcoin School Kenya aims to establish 47 training hubs one in each Kenyan county staffed by local representatives. This decentralized model draws  emphasizes community-driven education.

Local Ambassadors: Representatives will be trained to teach in their native languages, ensuring cultural resonance.

Inclusivity: Special programs for women, farmers, and small businesses.

Economic Empowerment: By teaching Bitcoin as a tool for savings, remittances, and entrepreneurship, the school wil also complement Kenya’s status as a global leader in mobile money (M-Pesa).

“Bitcoin without the people is just code.” — Matt Odell 2. At Bitcoin School Kenya, we’re putting people first. 🌍✨
