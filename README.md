# 🌐 Light-Node-Directory

The Node Network is a core initiative of **My First Bitcoin**, designed to ignite a global, unstoppable wave of open-source Bitcoin education.

## 🎯 Purpose

The mission? **Simple but bold**: Empower individuals. Strengthen communities. Decentralize knowledge.

The **Light-Node-Network repository** facilitates:

### 📁 Personalized Directories  
Each Light Node has its own dedicated directory to store and share customized content, local resources, and translated materials.  
This transparency is key – it reflects each node’s commitment to Bitcoin education and creates a collaborative environment where everyone can learn from each other’s work.

### 🧰 Resources in One Place  
A shared hub containing updates, templates, and open-source educational materials – all designed to help you get started and scale your impact.  
Because Bitcoin education belongs to everyone, everywhere – and by sharing tools and knowledge, we all grow stronger together.

### 🤝 Collaborative Communication  
This is more than just a space to talk. It’s where Light Nodes connect, support one another, and share hard-earned insights.  
Because in this mission, sharing is caring – one success or failure can ripple outward and make a difference across the globe.

🗣️ Open, honest, and direct communication moves us forward. Together.
